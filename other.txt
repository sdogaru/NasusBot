Advanced Statistics Pathway:
QUESTIONS:

- figure out hosting
-- was able to use pipreqs to generate a requirements.txt,everything should be good on heroku if solve the pandas issues w/ buildpack https://elements.heroku.com/buildpacks/pandas-dev/pandas#buildpack-instructions


- apply for rate limit increase + change name to nasus bot
-- give description of the bot
-- make github public and refer them to that for command list
-- explain need for rate limit expansion, how im using mongodb atlas already, where the ratelimit bottleneck is, etc.
--- Ex. Getting match data for the first time, for a player whos played 500 games this season, the current rate limit of 100 req every 2 min would take 10+ minutes. Since the matches are stored in a database, subsequent calls would take mere seconds, with hardly any requests made to the riot games api.   

-- provide with options to either join the testing server, or download on their own
- when approved, publish to top.gg and other bot sites
- performance tweaks to minimize # of requests
- add comments
- get matchv5 ready
- lee sin, j4, wukong, all have weird names and need a mapping
-sharding? https://anidiots.guide/understanding/sharding
-- sharding not reccomended until 2500+ guilds


REFACTOR CODE AND ADD DB
- transition to matchv5 api once they open to production keys.
noget match list dto in matchv5 :( so some code change will be necessary.

mongodb atlas is 512 mb (500k-1m entries). Can switch to local for unlimited space...
