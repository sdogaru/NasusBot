Advanced Statistics Pathway:

need a ratelimiting mechanism

getMatchList Use champion identifier + queueID(use preset values. either ranked,flex,norms,draft,all)
(IDs 420,440,430,440,None)

and iterate on 100 game intervals using indexing until the year changes.
display Season + Year in embed. So like Season 2021


--> Each call returns a list of matchListDTos, which have queueID, champion,lane,season and gameID
----> For each entry, we use getMatch api and retrieve statistics

store the entire match object, NOT this

 

{
	accountId,
	gameId,
	queueId,
	champion,
	lane,
	timestamp,
	cs,
	cs/min,
	kills,
	deaths,
	assists,
	gold,
	damageToChampions,
	damageToObjectives,
	damageTaken,
	win
}

QUESTIONS:
REFACTOR CODE AND ADD DB

- transition to matchv5 api once they open to production keys.
noget match list dto in matchv5 :( so some code change will be necessary.

duo champion parameter too?

batch store matches in db

then, for additional requests, we always use the getMatchList as we iterate, but check the db for the gameId before* using getMatch.

handle bad input for /stats . empty usernames, etc
- banned user
- empty user
- duo same username as main
- etc
