Advanced Statistics Pathway:
QUESTIONS:

- apply for rate limit increase

- publish to top.gg and other bot sites

- need to make slash commands global

- add comments and mild refactoring //maybe a flexible error handler for all the api methods where a function is passed in? idk

-change from primetime to ahri (to nasus??) everywhere
- move gifs to image file

- add support for different regions outside of NA - take region param in front end but make changes in api backend
-- im thinking we pass in region as a field for the classes that inherit from api, which then pass that field up to api. 
-- matchv5 edge case different region names/url
-- make changes in db method too lol
- get matchv5 ready

- lee sin, j4, wukong, all have weird names and need a mapping

- publish to top.gg and other sites

-sharding? https://anidiots.guide/understanding/sharding
-- sharding not reccomended until 2500+ guilds



REFACTOR CODE AND ADD DB
- transition to matchv5 api once they open to production keys.
noget match list dto in matchv5 :( so some code change will be necessary.

mongodb atlas is 512 mb (500k-1m entries). Can switch to local for unlimited space...
