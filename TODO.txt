-change from primetime to ahri everywhere

make entry message into embed

consistency for user input? Like use API to get official spelling/casing of usernames and champion namesno matter what the user inputs

incorporate ratelimit support. easiest way is probably to incorporate it into the api make request method, so it automatically is supported by all subclasses.

maybe nosql db to store matches and other info. bring # of requests down

/botlaneduo [user1] [user2]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

/championstats [username] [champion] [queue]

- returned W/L, mode, time , champion, KDA, gold for last game played
